In this folder all the data are from Jan 2013.

The waiting time has been attached prior to the pickup (i.e. the total time is computed between two successive dropoff).

I chose two different cutoff for the waiting time after which I would declare that the taxis are just not being used, 1h and 30min.

It would be nice instead to retrive the locations where the taxis stay parked and exclude the taxis that are in those locations, but I doubt the result would be much different.

Also, one could study how the situation change with different cutoffs and it would be interesting to develop a web app where this parameter can be tuned.
